  ## Custom Styling

  It is necessary to access any element through the member and apply the style, as in the example below:

  ```css
  /* CalendarCustomStyles.css */

  .week-time-header__number {
      color: #205c97
  }

  .week-time-view-inside {
    background-color: #f8faff;
  }
  ```

  ```jsx
  import './CalendarCustomStyles.css';

      ...

      <Calendar
        data={[
          {
            id: '1',
            startTime: '2023-06-02T01:10:00Z',
            endTime: '2023-06-02T03:10:00Z',
            title: 'Conference',
          },
        ]}
        currentView='WEEK_TIME'
        currentDate='2023-06-01'
        activeTimeDateField='startTime-endTime'
      />

    ...
  ```

  <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  When writing the rest of the `css` for your application, make sure that the class names do not match with those of the calendar component. This is unlikely because component class names are very calendar specific.
  </Callout>

  Above is a basic example where the background of the calendar and day of the week has been changed for just WEEK_TIME view. By the same principle,
  you can access any element, you need to use inspect and look at the element `className` of any component, then apply a certain style.
