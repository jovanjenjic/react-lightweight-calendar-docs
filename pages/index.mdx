    ## What is React Lightweight Calendar?

    The Calendar component is designed to offer a wide range of customization options, enabling you to tailor both its appearance and behavior according to your needs.
    Whether you're dealing with events, orders, activity schedules, reservations, bookings, rentals, or any other entity that follows the ISO 8601 time date format, this calendar can efficiently handle it. You have the flexibility to position each element on the calendar based on
    a single field, any field within the data array, or even by defining intervals using two time date fields separated by a hyphen (-).

    ### Responsive to the core
    The Calendar component ensures that your calendar interface remains visually appealing and functional across different screen sizes. With intuitive responsive variants, you can easily create a seamless user experience without the need for custom CSS.

    ### Component-friendly
    The Calendar component is component-friendly, making it easy to organize and maintain your code as your project grows. You can extract common patterns into higher level abstractions, streamlining updates to multiple instances of a component from a single location.

    ### Designed to be customized
    The Calendar component is a highly customizable and versatile tool for displaying events and schedules in various views. It accepts a wide range of props that allow you to tailor the calendar to your specific needs.
    In summary, the Calendar component goes beyond being a simple CSS framework. It serves as a powerful engine for creating custom design systems and providing a seamless event display solution for your applications.

    ## Technology Stack

    The Calendar component is built with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and providing better tooling support. It also comes with test coverage, guaranteeing its reliability and stability. During the development process, we have utilized pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (TypeScript).
    Additionally, the only external library utilized in the development of this calendar is date-fns, which assists with handling date-related functionalities.

    ## Future Development

    Our team is committed to enhancing the Calendar component further. We plan to introduce additional views and functionalities to make it even more powerful and user-friendly.
    The prioritization of these new features will be determined by the emerging needs and requirements of our users.
    Thank you for choosing the React Lightweight Calendar Component. We hope this tool proves to be valuable in visualizing and managing your entities effectively. If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
    Happy calendaring!
