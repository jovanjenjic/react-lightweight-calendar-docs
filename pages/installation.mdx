    # Install React Lightweight Calendar with CLI

    Now you can install and use your MReact Lightweight Calendar package faster using CLI. See below our step-by step guide.

    A CLI (short for "command-line interface") is a user interface that operates through text commands and enables the execution of various functions within an operating system. It proves particularly useful for automating and streamlining the process of setting up the scaffolding for your web projects.
